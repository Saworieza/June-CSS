		<description><![CDATA[In answer to &quot;what do you want to see on CSS Newbie in 2009?” I had been building web sites without CSS for a long time. I had an approach that worked for me and used lots of tables. Now that it&#039;s considered gauche, I&#039;m trying to use it more. But frankly, I find it excruciatingly difficult to figure out how to structure anything but the simplest layouts. Grids require jumping through CSS hoops. Making adjustments requires massive changes just to, say change your gutter widths.

So I&#039;d like to see a systematic methodology that will help me create a flexible layout from scratch.

Peace,
