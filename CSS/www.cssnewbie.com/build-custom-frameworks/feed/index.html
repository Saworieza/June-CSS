		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve looked at other CSS frameworks but they seem to complex. I like you&#039;rs for it&#039;s simplicity.

Since the col class appears in every div, why not just include the float:left in the span classes? Just a thought. I&#039;m new at this so maybe there&#039;s some example to keep the flexibility of having it separate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Steven,

I can do it because I&#039;ve never downloaded the Blueprint framework, and thus have no idea how they do what they do.

And now that I&#039;ve downloaded it for a reference point, I can see that by &quot;shamelessly copied,&quot; you mean that they also used the word &quot;span&quot; to create widths (though theirs are written differently), meaning I wasn&#039;t the first person on earth to conceive of a correlation between a colspan and a grid span. Mind boggling stuff. 

Many frameworks share a lot of elements in common, since they&#039;re trying to accomplish the same fundamental ends. For example, I guarantee that the YUI grid system uses the width property (though I&#039;ve never downloaded it either). So by your logic, Blueprint is a ripoff of them, correct?

Bare minimum I would say that mine is different because it contains 9 rules, whereas theirs contains 240 rules. Or possibly because mine isn&#039;t meant to be a standalone framework at all, but rather a starting point from which others can build their own framework (and thus understand how the framework works) instead of just grabbing someone else&#039;s code and running. Had you actually stopped to read my article instead of skipping to the code, noticing a similarity, and then jumping to conclusions, you would have realized that was my whole point to begin with.

Thanks for playing,
-Rob]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rob, please explain how you can write this and never once use the tern &quot;blueprint&quot;, as in BluePrint.css, from which all this is apparently shamelessly copied.

		<description><![CDATA[Never thought about putting the gutter in it&#039;s own class. Much better idea than doing a &quot;last&quot; class that removes a built-in gutter.

If I might make a couple of suggestions, though. Name your col class something like .float-left, and your clear class to .clear-left.

This gives you the ability to use them in other places other than framework, and gives you a descriptive name so that you can remember what they were doing later on.]]></description>
