		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t rest until I worked out why the display: inline; and line-height declarations were in the original. Well, they were there to make IE6 (and earlier) work of course! I started from a standards compliant browser and then forgot that IE6 is still being used, regrettably. So, here&#039;s code that should work in most browsers (with the lines that fix IE6 all beginning with an underscore - meaning only IE6 reads them - all other browsers ignore them):

ul#nav {
	position: absolute;
	top: 10px;
	right: 0;
	list-style: none;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	overflow: auto;
	_height: 1%;
	}

ul#nav li {
	float: left;
	}

ul#nav li a {
	display: block;
	_position: relative;
	_display: inline-block;
	padding: 13px 5px 7px 5px;
	margin-right: 5px;
	background-color: #034a7f;
	color: #fff;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-decoration: none; }

ul#nav li a:hover {
	padding-top: 17px;
	background-color: #075a97; }

One final IE6 quirk. If you upload this to your host and run the file in IE6 it is fine. If you run it locally, then you may need to refresh the page before the menu will appear (tried the peekaboo fixes and they don;t work).

This only applies if the menu is positioned absolutely. If it is in the normal flow, it is fine. Can anyone suggest why?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if one misunderstanding leads to another. The code can more properly be written as:

ul#nav {
	position: absolute;
	top: 10px;
	right: 0;
	list-style: none;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	overflow: auto;
	}

ul#nav li {
	float: left;  }

ul#nav li a {
/*	display: inline;
	float: left;*/
	display: block;
	padding: 13px 5px 7px 5px;
/*	line-height: 2em;*/
	margin-right: 5px;
	background-color: #034a7f;
	color: #fff;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-decoration: none; }

Where it starts to get skewed with this attempt create a horizontal menu is the missing [overflow: auto;] declaration on the ul element. This declaration forces the ul parent to wrap around the floated li children, the use of the succeeding float of the a element is then not required (actually gets in the way in some browsers). And why is the [display: inline;] declaration there I wonder?

Now, the a element (normally an inline element) can usefully get the [display: block] declaration added. This then allows vertical settings (margins, padding etc.) to apply properly. Is this why line-height was included - because padding was not giving the required vertical spacing? I don&#039;t know but set the top and bottom padding values as shown and line-height setting is redundant.

To end: in this example, because the ul element has [position: absolute;] which takes it out of the normal document flow, then [overflow: auto;] is not needed but I included it for completeness.
