		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rich,

I don&#039;t see what you&#039;re seeing, but I do see something that could be a problem in your print CSS. The first line says body { visibility: invisible; }. This could prove problematic for two reasons. 

First, visibility: invisible isn&#039;t a real CSS rule (did you mean display: none?), so some browsers may choke on that and stop there. Second, even if browsers did figure out the rule, that probably wouldn&#039;t be what you wanted. Since everything lives inside the body tag, if you made it invisible, nothing would show up on your page. So I&#039;d take a look at that rule and figure out what you want it to do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi - great advice thanks -- but i have a query.

My print.CSS is working ok except that I have my IMAGES in a &#039;right&#039; floating DIV [so that i can have captions below the images] and when I print in IE6 or 7 what happens is the main page text no longer wraps around the image DIV but stops before the image DIV and then starts again after it. Pretty frustrating as it works oerfectly in FF and SAFARI. Is there anyway I can get the floating images DIV to print out so that the text wraps around it nicely - as it does on the screen version?]]></description>
