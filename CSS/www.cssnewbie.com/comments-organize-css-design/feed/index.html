This piece really did switch the light on for me as far as this specific subject matter goes. Nonetheless there is actually 1 issue I am not too comfortable with and whilst I try to reconcile that with the actual central idea of the point, let me see what all the rest of your readers have to say.Nicely done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello would you mind sharing which blog platform you&#039;re using? I&#039;m planning to start my own blog soon but I&#039;m having a hard time deciding between BlogEngine/Wordpress/B2evolution and Drupal. The reason I ask is because your design and style seems different then most blogs and I&#039;m looking for something completely unique.                  P.S Apologies for being off-topic but I had to ask!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen stylesheets with a big comment at the top that summarizes all the colors used therein — the hex code, a human-readable description, and a blurb about which parts of the site use it.

This makes it really easy to find, for example, that the blue-green you use is #417690. It also makes it easy to do a quick search-and-replace to change your color palette.

I just need to make myself adopt the same practice. :)]]></description>
