		<description><![CDATA[There is no explanation how you got those leaves and stem rotated, did you just try to make the article seem more interesting by rotating the picture taken from your work? Because what you explained was a disappointing, it was simple thing to do with basic understanding of CSS, but the image fooled me to read to article - I was so excited to find in the end an explanation/code on how can they be made rotated but felt scammed... Please reply here or by email and tell me either that I missed something reading your instructions or just tell what made you decide it was a good idea to place image in the top giving false expectation that you could actually learn something more special on this article...

Don&#039;t mean to offend, but I was left disappointed and having wasted time when I have lot of several works to do :/]]></description>
