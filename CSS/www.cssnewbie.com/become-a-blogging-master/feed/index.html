		<description><![CDATA[I kept waiting for the punchline when you were going to come out and make fun of this guy. This was really jarring. And a pretty empty scheme on [silly &quot;expert&#039;s&quot; name redacted]. Doesn&#039;t it feel pyramid schemey to you? I&#039;d be surprised if you get a single signup, and for all that, your credibility takes a major hit. 

I prefer Gabe and Max&#039;s Internet Thing ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPsUmhqncAg ) as my tutors for making money on the internets.

I love your work on CSS; it&#039;s extremely helpful to me. If you don&#039;t have time to do it because of other commitments, my suggestion is not to drastically change the content, but just write less frequently, only when you can and the mood and interest strikes you. What you&#039;ve already done serves as a fantastic resource. Even if you only published one article a month, I&#039;d still be happy to be subscribed.]]></description>

Better let the first line of an article like this be &quot;this is a sponsored message&quot; or something like that...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good questions, both. And I&#039;ll be wholly honest in return.

There are two things going on here:

1. While this website is generally about CSS, I don&#039;t want to talk ~exclusively~ about CSS. Without HTML, CSS is useless. Without JavaScript, CSS can&#039;t reach its full modern-day potential. And without blogs... well, this website would be a heck of a lot more difficult to maintain, at least. 

I want the latitude to talk about the whole scope of web development -- while hopefully never losing sight of the fact that, in the end, this website should be a great resource for those learning CSS.

2. This type of post is something new I&#039;m trying. Basically, Yaro has an affiliate program set up for the Blog Mastermind program. If someone goes from my site to his through the links I&#039;ve provided, and then decides to sign up for the program, I&#039;ll receive a bit of compensation in return. 

I&#039;ve never done this type of article before, and I&#039;m going to gauge reader reaction before I do another one. My hope is that it will prove informative to my readers (or at least not insulting!) and simultaneously monetarily beneficial for me. At the end of the day, this website takes a good deal of time and effort to maintain, and it&#039;d be easier to justify spending my time here if the site were generating revenue. Otherwise, I have a full-time job, a fiancee, a wedding, freelancing gigs, teaching gigs, and a couple of other websites all vying for my attention!

---

So, there&#039;s the honest truth. If you&#039;re willing to accept my argument, great. If you disagree with my methods, let me know. Although, be forewarned that I&#039;m much more receptive to arguments that offer a viable alternative solution. :)]]></description>
