		<description><![CDATA[I use the table of content section at the top of the css file to also add when the file was created and the last time it was edited, my email address, ect. This way, a client has all of that information right there in case they run into a problem. Something like below:

/* Table of Contents:
     File Created: March 11th 2008
     File Last Edited: March 13th 2008
     File Creator: Mike Smith
     Contact File Creator: myemail@address.com

		<description><![CDATA[Good observation, Scott. I&#039;m hoping to cover that technique in a future article. :) 

I personally rarely use that technique, however, because I don&#039;t tend to think of my websites as organized according to typography vs. layout. I see a &quot;sidebar&quot; (for example) as a cohesive unit, with its own layout and typographical considerations. I quickly get annoyed when I want to bump up a header size by a few percentage points and move it by a couple of pixels, and that requires me to edit more than one style sheet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You said that you create a table of content when your style sheets get hundreds or thousands of lines long. I&#039;ve seen sites that break the css into separate files such as: reset.css, typography.css, layout.css, etc. Do you see any value in approaching the organization that way instead?]]></description>
