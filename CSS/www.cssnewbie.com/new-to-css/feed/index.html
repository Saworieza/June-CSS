This is a true &quot;stumble upon&quot; happening for me.
I was looking for a friendly CSS tutorial and look what I found!
I am bookmarking it for regular reading to gain some CSS expertise.
Thanks for the tutorial.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good Afternoon Rob,
I would like to ask two questions!
 
1)I want to start a blog where I need a format of two columns.  The layout should be such that comments can be entered in either column independent of each other down the entire page. I think this could be accomplished by tables and then entering the code for the comment section, but I do not know how to actually layout the code. I would like the comment format to be identical to how it is displayed on CSS Newbie with an dual option for &#039;name&#039;, email and as stated above, the comments sections. The columns should be separated by a 25px space. Of course there should be space on the outer sides of both columns.

2) As you can see on my current blog much is lacking.  Can you tell me what font is good to use and recommended a font size?  I have just learned HTML and CSS is so new to me! I do not understand it and cannot locate any clues to the font, font size, font color etc. when viewing a source code.  I like a clean interface and the font type on this site is ideal for me. As well, do you have a tutorial and/or article primer, i.e. CSS 101 with regard to page formatting, styles of blogs, and all the simple basics for the newest newbie you ever saw! 

Keep up the good work,
