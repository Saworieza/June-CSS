		<description><![CDATA[Oh... my.... word....

Thank, YOU!!!! I have been pulling my hair out trying to get an accordion script using prototype to work with everything else which is jquery. I&#039;m not a JS expert, so you taking the time to explain it helped me ALOT.

One thing that I&#039;m sure most of you know, but it was giving me alot of trouble, is you apparently have to load prototype first, THEN jquery, then your jQuery.noConflict(); . I had jquery first then prototype (and 4 other external JS files) and they still weren&#039;t playing well together. Swapped it and all is well.

Thanks again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Rob. I had never run into the noConflict() function before. Good to know.

But really. What CAN&#039;T you do with jQuery that would make you want to use anything else? :)]]></description>
